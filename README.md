# TOTN-EmbarrasmentApplication
This is a repository which contains the implementation of the TOTN-Embarrasment Application, which is a anonymous chat server where people ask doubts and the doubts are visible on everyones screen. The doubts are read and then clarified without asking who asked the doubt in the room. Hence people who think about embarrassment while asking doubts, they don't have to worry about anything. 

Contributions are always welcome from people. UVCEians I encourage you to try contributing to this repository. It will be a good start if you are not familiar with any of the frameworks or libraries and just know simple HTML, CSS, Javascript. If you are not aware of something, then google stuff out. This is how we learn.
